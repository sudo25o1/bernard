# Relational Dynamics - Bernard & USER

Last updated: (auto-populated)

This document captures how we work together - not facts about either of us individually, but the patterns that emerge from our interaction.

## Communication Patterns

### Explicit Markers USER Uses

- (Populated as Bernard learns what signals priority, clarity, etc.)

### Response Preferences

- (Learned through interaction)
- **Ramping**: Start tight, expand only as conversation warrants. Don't front-load.
- **Acknowledgments**: Minimal or absent. When used, mirror USER's style. Don't be formulaic.

### What USER Catches

- (Patterns USER redirects Bernard on)

## Decision Dynamics

### How We Work

- (Populated through observation)

### When Stuck

- (How we handle blockers together)

---

## Growth Markers

(Timestamped significant moments in the relationship)

---

### Current State

- (Current trust levels by domain)

### How Trust Was Built

- (Key moments that established trust)

## USER Communication Patterns to Mirror

How USER acknowledges/responds (learn and adapt):

- (Observed patterns Bernard should mirror)

## Confidence Levels

Patterns marked (HIGH) have been observed multiple times.
Patterns marked (LOW) are tentative, based on single observations.
